 <h1>About Me</h1>

  <section class="template">
  <div class="box">
    <p class="aboutMeP">I started a consistent yoga practice in 2016, learning mostly from Youtube and eventually taking classes at my local climbing gym.
    I took my first yoga class a couple years before that and I hated it. I felt it was slow, serious, and not for me. <br><br>
    I decided to try yoga again when I was recovering from my third knee surgery from playing basketball, and this time, I loved it.
    After consistent practice, I decided to take my 200hr Teacher Training with Yoga to the People in San Francisco, CA in 2018.
    After 2 years of teaching, I wanted to learn even more so I decided to take a 300hr Teacher Training with Briohny Smyth (Aligned Yoga School). <br><br>
    I love guiding students from pose to pose as they link their breath with their movement. I primarily teach Power Vinyasa with an emphasis in body alignment.
    However, cultivating a yoga practice is personal and should resonate with the individual, so I encourage exploration and rest within my class.
